# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (facilitated by Project Manager or Scrum Master)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (led by Product Manager with Business Analyst support)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. Confirm roles and responsibilities across team (Developers, UX Designer, DevOps Engineer, QA, etc.)
